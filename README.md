<div align="center">

  The project was to create a maze generator that can generate either a perfect or imperfect maze. <br>
  A perfect maze is a maze that has only one possible path. <br>
  On the countrary, an imperfect maze is a one that has multiple paths.
  <br>
  For this we used the  <br>
  <br>
  For the solving part we used Tr√©maux's algorithm. <br>
  It finds always find a path, except when their are none but will not find the shortest one. <br>
